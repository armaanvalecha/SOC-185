# SOC-185
This repository contains all my solutions for the questions I have received by my mentors as weekly assignments.
Our first and second week has included brushing up some older concepts of c++, learning time and space complexity and learning different data structures including arrays, strings, vectors, stack, queue, maps, set and Hash table. For the third week after the midterm checkpoint, we learnt sorting and searching and were required to sove some problems keeping in mind the time complexity for each question. With this, our journey of SOC 185 ended.
